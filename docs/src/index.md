# MCMCDiagnosticTools

MCMCDiagnosticTools provides functionality for diagnosing samples generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

## Background

Some methods were originally part of [Mamba.jl](https://github.com/brian-j-smith/Mamba.jl) and then [MCMCChains.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/MCMCChains.jl).
This package is a joint collaboration between the [Turing](https://turinglang.org/) and [ArviZ](https://www.arviz.org/) projects.
